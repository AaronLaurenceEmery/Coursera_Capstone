We will explore correlation between factors to determine which factors will be most useful in our predictive model.  \n  \nWe will break the data into training and test sets in order to generate a predictive model to determine the likelihood of an accident, as well as the likelihood of injury in the event of an accident\n\nAdditionally, we can use these results to identify potential problem areas within the city to determine if we can take steps to mitigate injury and property damage risks"
